# Dan Currier's Interactive Password Generator 

## Description
Hi there! My name is Daniel Currier, and this is my first JavaScript project. This is made as a test of my understanding of the language and its applications. After many hours of coding (and recoding) I have created a generator that matches the criteria of the given project. Please refer to the Usage section to know how it works!

Left click on the "Generate" button to begin the process. You will be provided with a series of prompts that will determine the criteria of your password's criteria. Options include a character length of 8-128, lowercase letters, upppercase letters, numbers, and special symbols(#,$,% etc.). After selecting your criteria, a password will be generated and printed in the text box above the button.

To copy the password, simply left click and drag across its contents, and press ctrl+c to copy it. Paste it wherever you see fit, and use this program as often as you need it!
